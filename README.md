# InventoryManager — FastAPI Backend

InventoryManager is a FastAPI backend for inventory management with JWT authentication, secure password hashing using Argon2 (primary) and bcrypt (fallback), SQL database support via SQLAlchemy/SQLModel with Postgres, and interactive API docs at /docs. A simple static frontend lives under /static and can be deployed on Netlify while the API and database run on Railway. Features include product CRUD (create, read, update, delete), user registration and login, JWT-based auth, password validation (8–64 chars), and quick testing with static HTML/CSS/JS pages. The tech stack includes Python 3.10+, FastAPI, SQLAlchemy/SQLModel, Postgres, JWT auth, passlib (argon2 + bcrypt), Uvicorn for local dev, and deployment via Netlify (frontend) and Railway (backend + database). To run locally, clone the repo, create a virtual environment, install dependencies with pip install -r requirements.txt, set environment variables in a .env file including DATABASE_URL, SECRET_KEY, and CORS_ORIGINS, then run uvicorn app.main:app --reload. The API endpoints include POST /auth/register to create a user, POST /auth/login to login and receive a JWT, GET /users/me to get current user info, GET /products to list products, POST /products to add a product, PUT /products/{id} to update a product, and DELETE /products/{id} to delete a product. For deployment on Railway, connect the repo, add Postgres, set env variables, and use uvicorn app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port $PORT. For the frontend on Netlify, deploy the /static folder as a site, optionally add a _redirects file for SPA routing, and ensure CORS_ORIGINS in the backend includes your Netlify URL. Planned improvements include refresh tokens, password reset, email verification, role-based access control, and CI/CD for tests, linting, and type-checks. License: MIT.
