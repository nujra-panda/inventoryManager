## ‚ú® Features

-   **Interactive API Docs:** Automatically generated documentation with Swagger UI at `/docs`.
-   **Secure Authentication:** JWT-based authentication for protected routes.
-   **Advanced Password Hashing:** Uses **Argon2** as the primary hashing algorithm with a **bcrypt** fallback for maximum security.
-   **Database Integration:** Built with SQLAlchemy and SQLModel for easy interaction with a Postgres database.
-   **Full CRUD Functionality:** Complete Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations for inventory products.
-   **Clean Architecture:** Organized code with distinct routers, schemas, and services.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

-   **Backend:** Python 3.10+, FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, SQLModel
-   **Authentication:** `python-jose` for JWT, `passlib` with `argon2-cffi` and `bcrypt`
-   **Database:** PostgreSQL
-   **Frontend:** Simple HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (served from the `/static` directory)
-   **Deployment:** Railway (API + Database) & Netlify (Static Frontend)

## üöÄ Quick Start (Local Setup)

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/](https://github.com/)<your-username>/InventoryManager.git
    cd InventoryManager
    ```

2.  **Create a Virtual Environment and Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    python -m venv .venv
    source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3.  **Set Up Environment Variables:**
    Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the following variables:
    ```
    DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@host:5432/dbname
    SECRET_KEY=your_super_secret_jwt_key
    CORS_ORIGINS=http://localhost:3000,[http://127.0.0.1:5500](http://127.0.0.1:5500)
    ```

4.  **Run the Server:**
    ```bash
    uvicorn app.main:app --reload
    ```

5.  **Access the API:**
    -   **API Docs (Swagger UI):** [http://localhost:8000/docs](http://localhost:8000/docs)
    -   **Alternate Docs (ReDoc):** [http://localhost:8000/redoc](http://localhost:8000/redoc)
